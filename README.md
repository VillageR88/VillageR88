I am currently working on **CWrap**, open microframework for web developers and those learning web development. Its key features include:

- 👶 Low entry level, making it accessible for beginners
- ✨ Automatic CSS generation
- 🔍 Autocompletion for faster coding
- 👀 Preview-based manipulation for real-time feedback
