### Hi there 👋

I am currently working on **CWrap**, a microframework for web developers and those learning web development. Its key features include:

- ✨ Automatic CSS generation
- 🔧 Low entry level, making it accessible for beginners
- 🔍 Autocompletion for faster coding
- 👀 Preview-based manipulation for real-time feedback
